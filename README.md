# ART
ART - Animation Rendering Tool. (PLT Project)
***MAJOR NOTE: IN ORDER FOR A ART PROGRAM TO COMPILE SUCCESSFULLY OPENGLUT AND ITS DEPENENDCIES NEED TO BE INSTALLED***

Run ``` bash testall.sh ``` to execute the test suite.

Run ```bash ./compile ./name-of-art-source-file ./name-of-program ``` in order to compile a art program(if you leave out the name of the ouput file it will use the name of the source file)

Type ```Make``` to compile just the ART compiler

See our demo folder for programs with actual animation
